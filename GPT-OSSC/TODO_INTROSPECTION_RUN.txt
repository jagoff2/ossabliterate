TODO: Introspective RL Enhancements

1. Report Alignment
   - [x] Keep the report head supervised during RL using gold_report labels and ensure no [report unavailable].
   - [x] Add a reward/penalty signal tied to attention-highlighted tokens (focus coverage bonus + penalty when absent).
   - [x] Penalize repeated report sentences to stop template spam.

2. Plan/Monitor Validation
   - [x] Tie plan/monitor bonuses to actual problem entities (numbers, variables, events).
   - [x] Add coverage/novelty penalties when Plan Steps repeat verbatim.

3. Reflection / Replay Tasks
   - Extend reflection prompts so pass #2 critiques pass #1 using workspace traces.
   - Reward when the reflection fixes a mistake, penalize when it repeats unchanged answers.

4. Workspace Trace Supervision
   - Feed attention snapshots into a classifier; reward agreement between report text and trace classifier.
   - Require a "Trace Summary" that names layers/heads, supervised with synthetic labels.

5. Global Workspace Memory
   - Expand memory entries with per-step descriptors and use them in later episodes.
   - Add a memory-consistency reward when later episodes reference stored snippets correctly.

6. Evaluation Harness
   - Build an automatic evaluator for plan adherence, diagnosis accuracy, confidence calibration, and report quality.
   - Run it every N episodes to catch regressions.

7. Training Schedule
   - Run training in monitored chunks, inspect logs/reports after each chunk, and adjust rewards accordingly.
